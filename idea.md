1. Project Overview

A secure, role-based web app that allows employees to submit travel bills and invoices, attach receipts, and request reimbursement. Admins manage users and perform final approval. Engineers act as intermediate verifiers/reviewers (optional step) depending on company workflow.

Goals:

Simplify submission and approval of travel expenses

Provide clear audit trail and attachments

Restrict account creation to Admins only

Support export, filters, notifications, and reporting

2. Roles & Permissions

Admin (full access)

Create employee & engineer accounts

View, edit, approve, reject any expense

Assign expenses to engineers (optional)

Manage company settings, categories, limits

Export reports (CSV/PDF)

Engineer

View expenses assigned to them

Mark verification status (verified / not verified)

Add comments and request additional information

Cannot create accounts or change admin settings

Employee (User)

Create / submit expense claims

Upload receipts/invoices (image/pdf)

Edit own drafts before submission

View status and admin/engineer comments

3. Key Features

Employee expense submission with multiple line items per claim

Attachment upload (receipts) with preview and basic OCR (optional)

Expense statuses: Draft → Submitted → Under Review → Verified → Approved → Rejected → Paid

Comments / audit trail for each action

Admin-driven account creation (employees & engineers)

Role-based dashboards and filtered lists

Bulk actions for admins (approve/reject/export)

Notifications (email/in-app) for status changes

Search, sorting, and filters (date range, status, user, amount, category)

Expense limits and category-based rules

Export reports (CSV/PDF)

4. User Stories

As an employee, I want to upload receipts and enter expense details so I can get reimbursed.

As an employee, I want to save an expense as draft so I can submit later.

As an engineer, I want to verify an assigned expense so admin can quickly approve it.

As an admin, I want to create accounts and approve expenses so the process remains controlled.

As an admin, I want to export monthly reports so accounting can reconcile payments.

5. Workflows
5.1 Submit Expense (Employee)

Employee logs in → navigates to "Create Expense"

Fills general info: Trip name, dates, destination, purpose

Adds one or more line items: date, category (travel, lodging, food, misc), amount, description

Uploads receipts (one per line item or multiple attachments)

Saves as Draft or Submits

On submit: status becomes Submitted, notification sent to Admin (and optionally assigned Engineer)

5.2 Verify & Approve

Engineer (if assigned) opens expense → verifies attachments/validity → marks Verified or requests more info

Admin reviews (and sees engineer verification) → Approve or Reject (can add comments)

On approval, status becomes Approved → accounting receives export for payout

POST /api/expenses — create expense (employee only)

GET /api/expenses/:id — details

PUT /api/expenses/:id — update (only owner or admin; only editable when draft or requested)

POST /api/expenses/:id/submit — change status to submitted (employee)

POST /api/expenses/:id/assign — assign to engineer (admin)

POST /api/expenses/:id/verify — engineer verification

POST /api/expenses/:id/approve — admin approve { comment }

POST /api/expenses/:id/reject — admin reject { comment }

GET /api/expenses/:id/attachments — list attachments

9. Validation & Business Rules

Only Admin can create user accounts

Expense submission requires at least one attachment for amounts above a configurable threshold

Maximum allowed file size: e.g., 10MB per file

Allowed file types: PDF, PNG, JPG

Line item amount must be > 0

Total amount = sum(line items) (computed on backend)

If an engineer is assigned, admin approval should consider engineer verification flag

Audit logs must record every status change

10. Non-functional Requirements

File storage on S3 or equivalent with signed URLs

Secure password handling (bcrypt/argon2)

Input validation and server-side checks

Responsive UI (mobile + desktop)

Logs and monitoring

Unit & integration tests for critical flows

11. Acceptance Criteria
