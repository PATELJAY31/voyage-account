# Travel Expense Management System

A comprehensive web application for managing company travel expenses with role-based access control, approval workflows, and audit logging.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Admin-only user creation** - Only administrators can create new user accounts
- **Expense draft/submit flow** - Employees can create drafts and submit for review
- **Assign→Verify→Approve lifecycle** - Engineers verify, admins approve expenses
- **File upload validation** - PDF, PNG, JPG files ≤10MB with proper validation
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** - Admin, Engineer, Employee roles with proper permissions
- **Comprehensive audit logging** - All actions tracked for compliance
- **Backend total computation** - Automatic calculation of expense totals

### User Roles
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, expense approval
- **Engineer**: Review and verify assigned expenses, add comments
- **Employee**: Create and submit expense claims, view own expenses

### Expense Workflow
1. **Draft** → Employee creates expense with line items
2. **Submitted** → Employee submits for review
3. **Under Review** → Admin assigns to engineer (optional)
4. **Verified** → Engineer verifies expenses
5. **Approved/Rejected** → Admin makes final decision
6. **Paid** → Accounting processes payment

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API, TanStack Query
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v6
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- **Testing**: Vitest, Testing Library
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project
- Git

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd voyage-account
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Database Setup

Run the Supabase migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed
supabase db reset

# Or manually run the migration file:
# supabase/migrations/20251005171552_6159c659-1917-425b-813e-9ef879ba396e.sql
```

### 5. Create Initial Admin User

Since only admins can create users, you'll need to manually create the first admin user in Supabase:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication → Users
3. Create a new user
4. Go to SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Replace 'user-id-here' with the actual user ID from auth.users
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role) 
VALUES ('user-id-here', 'admin');
```

### 6. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
