## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Service Layer Pattern
- Implemented `ExpenseService` class for centralized business logic
- Separates concerns between UI and business logic
- Enables proper testing and reusability
- Maintains consistency across different components

### Validation Strategy
- **Frontend**: Zod schemas for immediate user feedback
- **Backend**: Service-level validation for security
- **Database**: Constraints and triggers for data integrity

### Error Handling
- Consistent error messages across the application
- Proper HTTP status codes
- User-friendly error displays
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual service methods
- Mock external dependencies (Supabase)
- Validate business logic correctness
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Validate user workflows end-to-end
- Test role-based access control
- Verify form validation and submission

### Test Coverage
- Service layer: 100% method coverage
- Component integration: Key user flows
- Error scenarios: Validation and permission errors
- Mocking: Supabase client and external services

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication via Supabase Auth
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Protected routes with role validation

### Data Validation
- Frontend validation with Zod schemas
- Backend validation in service layer
- File type and size validation
- Input sanitization and validation

### Audit Trail
- All user actions logged in `audit_logs` table
- Timestamp and user tracking
- Action-specific comments
- Immutable audit records

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project
- Git

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd voyage-account
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**

### Frontend Optimization
- React Query for caching and synchronization
- Proper component memoization
- Efficient re-rendering strategies

### File Upload Optimization
- Client-side validation before upload

- Proper error handling and retry logic

## 🐛 Known Limitations & Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- **Supabase-based**: Implementation uses Supabase instead of Next.js/Express/Prisma as originally specified
- **JWT Authentication**: Uses Supabase Auth instead of custom auth implementation
- **File Storage**: Uses Supabase Storage instead of S3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS instead of Prisma ORM

### Business Assumptions
- **Admin Creation**: First admin user must be created manually in Supabase
- **Email Notifications**: Not implemented (would require additional Supabase configuration)
- **Bulk Operations**: Not implemented for expense management
- **Advanced Reporting**: Basic analytics only

### Security Assumptions
- **File Validation**: Client-side validation only (backend validation would require Supabase Edge Functions)
- **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented (would require additional middleware)
- **Session Management**: Relies on Supabase Auth session handling

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- Email notifications for status changes
- Bulk expense operations
- Advanced filtering and search
- Export functionality (CSV/PDF)

### Long Term
- Mobile application
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with accounting systems
- Multi-tenant support

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ Admin-only user creation with proper validation
- ✅ Complete expense draft/submit workflow
- ✅ Engineer verification and admin approval process
- ✅ File upload validation (PDF/JPG/PNG ≤10MB)
- ✅ Comprehensive RBAC with backend validation
- ✅ Full audit logging for all actions
- ✅ Backend total computation for expenses
- ✅ Unit and integration test coverage
